2. Enter your name, email, and a strong passphrase
3. Follow the entropy collection process:
   - Move your mouse around the collection area
   - Type random text in the input field
   - Wait for sufficient entropy to be collected
4. Click **"Generate Key Pair"** and wait for completion

### 3. Encrypt Your First Message
1. Switch to the **Messages** tab
2. In the **Compose** section:
   - Select a recipient (must have their public key)

## Security Best Practices

### Passphrase Security
- Use a strong, unique passphrase for each key
- Include uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters
- Make it at least 12 characters long
- Don't reuse passphrases from other accounts

### Key Management
- Create regular backups of your keys
- Store backups in a secure, separate location
- Never share your private key or passphrase
- Verify recipient public keys before encrypting

### Message Security
- Use the "Burn Message" feature for sensitive communications
- Don't leave decrypted messages visible on screen
- Clear clipboard after copying encrypted messages
- Use the emergency kill switch if your computer is compromised

## Backup and Recovery

### Creating Backups
1. Go to **File ‚Üí Create Backup**

## Technical Details

### Encryption Standards
- **Algorithm**: RSA with OAEP padding
- **Key Sizes**: 2048, 3072, or 4096 bits
- **Hash Function**: SHA-256
- **Format**: OpenPGP standard (RFC 4880)

### Entropy Collection
- **Mouse Movement**: X/Y coordinates and timing
- **Keyboard Input**: Key press timing and patterns
- **Random Text**: User-provided random text
- **Minimum Entropy**: 256 bits for key generation

### Data Storage
- **Location**: `data/` folder in application directory
- **Key Storage**: GnuPG keyring format
- **Encryption**: All private keys encrypted with user passphrase
- **Backup Format**: AES-256 encrypted JSON

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Application won't start**
- Ensure all files are in the same folder
- Run `run_pgp_tool.bat` to check dependencies
- Check Windows compatibility (Windows 7+)

**Key generation fails**
- Ensure sufficient entropy is collected
- Try moving mouse more actively
- Type more random text

**Encryption/Decryption fails**
- Verify recipient's public key is imported
- Check passphrase is correct
- Ensure message format is valid PGP

**Import/Export issues**
- Verify file format is ASCII armor (.asc)
- Check file permissions
- Ensure complete key data is copied
